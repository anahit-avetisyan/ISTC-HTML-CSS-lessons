    <p>Christmas Day is celebrated as a major festival and public holiday in countries around the world,
     including many whose populations are mostly <br> non-Christian. In some  non-Christian areas, 
     periods of former colonial rule introduced the celebration (e.g. Hong Kong); in others, 
     Christian<br> minorities or foreign cultural influences have led populations to observe the holiday.
      Countries such as Japan, where Christmas is popular <br>despite there being only a small number of 
      Christians, have adopted many of the secular aspects of Christmas, such as gift-giving, decorations,
       and <br>Christmas trees.<br>
        The practice of putting up special decorations at Christmas has a long history. 
       In the 15th century, it was recorded that in London it was the custom at <br> Christmas for every 
       house and all the parish churches to be "decked with holm, ivy, bays, and whatsoever the season 
       of the year afforded to be green". <br> The heart-shaped leaves of ivy were said to symbolize the
        coming to earth of Jesus, while holly was seen as protection against pagans and witches,<br> its 
        thorns and red berries held to represent the Crown of Thorns worn by Jesus at the crucifixion
         and the blood he shed.

    <figcaption><b>The History of Christmas Trees</b></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
            The evergreen fir tree has traditionally been used to celebrate winter festivals 
            (pagan and Christian) for thousands of years.<br> Pagans used branches of it to decorate 
            their homes during the winter solstice, as it made them think of the spring to come.<br>
             The Romans used Fir Trees to decorate their temples at the festival of Saturnalia. 
             Christians use it as a sign of everlasting <br>life with God.<br>

            Nobody is really sure when Fir trees were first used as Christmas trees. 
            It probably began about 1000 years ago in Northern <br>Europe. Many early Christmas Trees seem 
            to have been hung upside down from the ceiling using chains (hung from <br>chandeliers/lighting 
            hooks).
            
            Other early Christmas Trees, across many parts of northern Europe, were cherry or hawthorn <br>
            plants (or a branch of the plant) that were put into pots and brought inside so they would
             hopefully flower at Christmas time. <br>If you couldn't afford a real plant, people made 
             pyramids of woods and they were decorated to look like a tree with paper,<br> apples and candles.
             times they were carried around from house to house, rather than being displayed in a home.
