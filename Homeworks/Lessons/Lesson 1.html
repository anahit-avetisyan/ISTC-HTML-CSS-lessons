         Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (Spanish pronunciation; "Royal Madrid Football Club")     <br>
      known as Real Madrid, is a professional football club based in Madrid, Spain.<br> 
      Founded on 6 March 1902 as the Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn <br>
      a white home kit since inception. The word real is Spanish for "royal" and was bestowed<br>
      to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 together with the royal crown in the emblem. <br>
        The team has played its home matches in the 81,044-capacity Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in <br>
        downtown Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting entities, Real Madrid's members<br>
        (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history.

      <p>The first crest had a simple design consisting of a decorative interlacing of <br> 
        the three initials of the club, "MCF" for Madrid Club de Fútbol, in dark blue on a white shirt.<br> 
        The first change in the crest occurred in 1908 when the letters adopted a more streamlined form <br> 
        and appeared inside a circle </p>
